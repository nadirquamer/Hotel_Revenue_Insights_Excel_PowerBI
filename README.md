### Business Problem

Atliq Grands a fictional company owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.  
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

### Task List

Assuming, I am the data analyst. I have been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting and have been provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in the form of a comic. Now I am excited to take on this challenge to build this dashboard and perform the following tasks.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
