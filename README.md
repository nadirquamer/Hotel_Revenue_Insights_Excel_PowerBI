### Business Problem

Atliq Grands a fictional company owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.  
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

### Task List

Assuming, I am the data analyst. I have been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting and have been provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in the form of a comic. Now I am excited to take on this challenge to build this dashboard and perform the following tasks.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

### Steps Followed

1. Import CSV files to PowerBI.
2. Performed data transformation and cleaning using power query on the imported data in Power BI.
3. Established relationships between different tables using data modeling.
4. Built measures and calculated columns per needs and used them for creating visuals in PowerBI.

### Data Model

Below is a screenshot of the data model after cleansed and prepared tables were read into Power BI.  
This data model also shows how fact_bookings have been connected to fact_aggregated bookings and other necessary dim_tables.

### Key Insights

- Data shows, that these hotels have a flat pricing strategy i.e. selling rooms at flat rates irrespective of peak or holiday season. So, there is a huge opportunity to increase revenue by adopting dynamic pricing, and weekday/weekend pricing as well.
- Some hotels don’t have good occupancy and cancellation is also high. So, data is clearly showing these hotels do not have good ratings. These need to be addressed by working on services and ratings with the help of customer reviews and feedback.
- Also, Hotels are not using any promotions strategy on their own channel, which most hotels do. They can offer promotions or coupons on their own channel without disrupting public prices. so that more people can end up booking from their own channel.
